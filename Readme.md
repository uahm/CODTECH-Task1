# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis and machine learning pipeline using Python. It includes loading and preprocessing a dataset, implementing a logistic regression model for classification, and evaluating model performance through various metrics. Visualization tools like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` help interpret the results effectively, making this project a valuable template for predictive analysis workflows.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Efficiently loads datasets with `pandas`, providing insights through data structure exploration and statistical summaries.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Prepares the data for modeling by handling missing values, scaling features, and removing outliers.
- **Model Training**: Implements logistic regression to classify or predict outcomes based on the dataset.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses the model with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Result Visualization**: Creates clear and informative visualizations of data and model results using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed to run the project:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uahm/Task1.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Task1
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Task1.ipynb`) to view and execute the pipeline steps.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Folder containing the dataset used for analysis and model training.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebook files with step-by-step code and explanations.
- **src/**: Python scripts for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation (if applicable).

## Usage

1. **Data Loading**: Load your dataset and explore its structure and key characteristics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
3. **Model Training**: Train a logistic regression model on the processed dataset.
4. **Evaluation and Visualization**: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and visualize the results for better interpretation.

## Results

This pipeline provides a detailed evaluation of the logistic regression model using various classification metrics, making it easy to assess the model's effectiveness. Visualizations give additional insights into data distributions, model predictions, and overall performance.
