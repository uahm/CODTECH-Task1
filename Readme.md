# 🚗 Exploratory Data Analysis on Vehicle Dataset

This project demonstrates a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** performed on a vehicle dataset. The goal is to understand key patterns, detect relationships between variables, and prepare the data for further modeling or insights.

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Load and clean the dataset  
- Drop irrelevant features for analysis  
- Understand variable distributions and data types  
- Visualize feature correlations and trends using plots

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset (`data.csv`) contains information on vehicles such as:
- Make
- Model
- Year
- Engine HP & Cylinders
- Transmission Type
- Driven Wheels
- Fuel Economy (City/Highway)
- MSRP (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price)

---

## 📷 Sample Visualizations

- Histogram of MSRP  
- Boxplot of Year vs. Price  
- Countplot of Transmission Type  
- Correlation heatmap
